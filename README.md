Hello! If you're reading this, I have good news and bad news for you.

The good news is that this library, while not the most optimized thing in the world, works, and it performs pretty well. I'm currently using it for another project.

The bad news is that there are virtually no comments in any of the code, and some of it is still pretty spaghettified. Sorry about that. I do plan to revisit this library in the future, but it isn't a priority for me right now.
