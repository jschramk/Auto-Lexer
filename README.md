Hello! If you're reading this, I have good news and bad news for you.

The good news is that this library, while not incredibly optimized, works, and it performs pretty well. I'm currently using it for another project to do some multilayer parsing.

The bad news is that there are virtually no comments in any of the code, and some of it is still pretty spaghettified. Sorry about that. I do plan to revisit this library in the future, but it isn't a priority for me right now.
